# Terms of Service
TaskBan is provided as is, under an open-source licence, with no warranty of any kind. If you find a bug, please [report](https://github.com/davidlang42/taskban/issues) it, or better yet, submit a [pull-request](https://github.com/davidlang42/taskban/pulls) to fix it yourself.

The tasks are only stored in Google Tasks™, no duplication/syncing takes place. Because of this it is a single user experience. There is a small amount of metadata stored in the Google Apps Script Properties Service, but this is also per user.

As always, you are bound by Google’s [terms of service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US) in using the Google Tasks™ ecosystem.
