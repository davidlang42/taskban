A kanban-style view of your Google Tasks. Each "list" in Google Tasks is shown as a "board" in TaskBan.

For example, if your Google Tasks list looks like this:

![Google Tasks](images/GoogleTasks.png)

It will be shown on a TaskBan board like this:

![TaskBan](images/TaskBan.png)

The tasks are only stored in Google Tasks, no duplication/syncing takes place. Because of this it is a single user experience.
There is a small amount of metadata stored in the Google Apps Script Properties Service, but this is also per user.
* Read more on the [privacy](privacy.md) and [terms of service](terms.md) pages.
