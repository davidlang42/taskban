# TaskBan
A kanban-style view of your Google Tasks.

The tasks are only stored in Google Tasks, no duplication/syncing takes place. Because of this it is a single user experience.
There is a small amount of metadata stored in the Google Apps Script Properties Service, but this is also per user.

Hosted directly on Google Apps Script, free for anyone to use: https://taskban.davidlang.net
(with optional static html iframe hosted on my home server to make the url look nice)

But by all means, [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/davidlang42).

As TaskBan is open-source, you can find the full source code at: https://github.com/davidlang42/taskban
